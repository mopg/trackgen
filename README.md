# trackgen
Tool to generate tracks quickly.

Guess an initial track: the number of straights, corners, and their order stays the same. The direction of the corner also stays the same. After that, an optimizer designs a track subject to the constraints you placed on it.
Also right-turning or left-turning track does not change.
